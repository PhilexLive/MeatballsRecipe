        <item name="first">Make the meatball mix, by placing the mince and add in the herbs, the egg and a splash of milk. Using your hands or a wooden spoon, gently mix and form into meatballs. The key to keeping the mince from going tough is being gentle when you roll the meatballs.</item>
        <item name="second">Using milk is the secret to getting juicy, moist meatballs every single time making them light and spongy.</item>
        <item name="third">The next step is mixing your meat mixture until the ingredients are just incorporated with your hands.  Full pieces of ground meat should still be visible.</item>
        <item name="fourth">Roll your meatballs with lightly oiled hands to prevent the meat from sticking to your fingers, while adding a little extra moisture into each meatball.</item>
        <item name="fifth">Heat some oil in a pan for browning the meatballs. We just fry them quickly to get colour on them and to form a golden crust and they finish cooking in the sauce. I used a nonstick skillet for this, but you can use a high sided regular skillet and make the sauce in it too.</item>
        <item name="sixth">Once the meatballs are browned all the way around remove them from the pan and set onto a baking tray. You may need to do this in batches to brown all the meatballs. This recipe makes 20 meatballs.</item>
        <item name="seventh">To make the sauce, heat some oil in a pan and soften the onion and garlic on medium heat. Add in some thyme and the tomato puree. Give it all a good stir and add in the passata. Add the meatballs to the sauce and simmer for about 10 minutes until the meatballs are cooked through.</item>
