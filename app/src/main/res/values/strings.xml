    <string name="first">Make the meatball mix, by placing the mince and add in the herbs, the egg and
        a splash of milk. Using your hands or a wooden spoon, gently mix and form into meatballs.
        The key to keeping the mince from going tough is being gentle when you roll the meatballs.

    <string name="second">Using milk is the secret to getting juicy, moist meatballs every single time
        making them light and spongy.
    </string>
    <string name="third">The next step is mixing your meat mixture until the ingredients are just
        incorporated with your hands. Full pieces of ground meat should still be visible.
    </string>
    <string name="fourth">Roll your meatballs with lightly oiled hands to prevent the meat from
        sticking to your fingers, while adding a little extra moisture into each meatball.
    </string>
    <string name="fifth">Heat some oil in a pan for browning the meatballs. We just fry them quickly
        to get colour on them and to form a golden crust and they finish cooking in the sauce. I
        used a nonstick skillet for this, but you can use a high sided regular skillet and make the
        sauce in it too.
    </string>
    <string name="sixth">Once the meatballs are browned all the way around remove them from the pan
        and set onto a baking tray. You may need to do this in batches to brown all the meatballs.
        This recipe makes 20 meatballs.

    <string name="seventh">To make the sauce, heat some oil in a pan and soften the onion and garlic
        on medium heat. Add in some thyme and the tomato puree. Give it all a good stir and add in
        the passata. Add the meatballs to the sauce and simmer for about 10 minutes until the
        meatballs are cooked through.
